UAA NLP Web Application
###################

This is a web application for the University of Alaska Anchorage, which I created as a one month project to provide the services of the most popular open-source Natural Langauge Processing frameworks in an easy to use interface.

The application was partly a learning project for myself in web application development. With that reasoning the PHP CodeIgniter framework was used for its light footprint, transparency in documentation, and the provided secure functions which take care of certain security flaws that need to be addressed for software deployment.
